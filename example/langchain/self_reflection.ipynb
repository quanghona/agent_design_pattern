The solution involves dynamic programming to efficiently determine the optimal cuts by leveraging previously computed results.\\n\\n### Approach\\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires partitioning a string into the fewest number of palindromic substrings. For example, the string \"aab\" can be partitioned into \"a\" and \"ab\" (but \"ab\" is not a palindrome), so the correct partition is \"aa\" and \"b\", requiring one cut.\\n\\n2. **Intuition**: We use dynamic programming to build up solutions for smaller substrings. The key insight is that if a substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome, then the minimum cuts needed for the substring `s[0..j]` can be derived from the minimum cuts for `s[0..i-1]` plus one.\\n\\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\\n   - **Precompute Palindromes**: First, we create a 2D array `is_pal` where `is_pal[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome.\\n   - **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cuts needed for the substring `s[0..i-1]`. The base case `dp[0]` is set to `-1` (indicating no cuts for an empty string).\\n   - **Filling DP Array**: For each position `i` from `1` to `n`, we check all possible starting positions `j` from `0` to `i-1`. If `s[j..i-1]` is a palindrome, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.\\n\\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we fill a 2D array of size `n x n` and then process each position in the `dp` array.\\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for the `is_pal` array and O(n) for the `dp` array.\\n\\n### Solution Code\\n```python\\ndef minCut(s: str) -> int:\\n    \"\"\"Return the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string into palindromic substrings.\\n\\n    Example:\\n        >>> minCut(\"aab\")\\n        1\\n        >>> minCut(\"a\")\\n        0\\n        >>> minCut(\"ab\")\\n        1\\n    \"\"\"\\n    n = len(s)\\n    is_pal = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\\n    \\n    for length in range(1, n + 1):\\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\\n            j = i + length - 1\\n            if length == 1:\\n                is_pal[i][j] = True\\n            elif length == 2:\\n                is_pal[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j])\\n            else:\\n                is_pal[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] and is_pal[i + 1][j - 1])\\n    \\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\\n    dp[0] = -1\\n    \\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\n        dp[i] = float(\\'inf\\')\\n        for j in range(i):\\n            if is_pal[j][i - 1]:\\n                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\\n    \\n    return dp[n]\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n1. **Precompute Palindromes**: The `is_pal` array is filled such that `is_pal[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome. This is done by checking substrings of increasing lengths.\\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[0] = -1` (base case for an empty string). For each position `i` in the string, we check all possible starting positions `j` to see if the substring `s[j..i-1]` is a palindrome.\\n3. **Update DP Array**: If a valid palindrome is found starting at `j`, we update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This step ensures that we always have the minimum cuts required up to position `i`.\\n4. **Result Extraction**: The value `dp[n]` gives the minimum cuts needed for the entire string `s`.\\n\\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging dynamic programming and precomputed palindrome information, ensuring optimal performance even for larger strings within the problem constraints.'} execution_result='success' error_message=None\n",
